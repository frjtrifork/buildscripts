buildscripts
===========

The scripts collected in this repository are mainly useful in situations where
you have a headless setup or need to do things from a buildserver like Jenkins. 

Or maybe you simply prefer to use the Terminal rather than click around in the
XCode UI.

XCode
=====
Scripts specific for iOS development will be collected in this folder.

The scripts can be used to install new provisioning profiles, re-sign 
IPA files for OTA distribution, build an XCode iOS project from scratch
for distribution using defined code signing identity and bundle identifier and
similar tasks.
